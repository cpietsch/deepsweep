# deepsweep
Interactive visualization  of the sensor data, plotting GPS trace, sensor and RF logs for [Julian Olivers](https://criticalengineering.org/projects/deep-sweep/) High-altitude Signal Research Project.
Greatly inspired by [Jason Davies](https://www.jasondavies.com/maps/raster/satellite/) satellite projection and [d3js](https://d3js.org).
